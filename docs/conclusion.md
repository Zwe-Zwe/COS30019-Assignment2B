# Conclusion

The Assignment 2B project successfully demonstrates the power of integrating distinct AI disciplines. By combining the deterministic precision of A* Search with the probabilistic power of Deep Learning, the ICS represents a modern approach to Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS).

Our work highlights that while Algorithm Selection (A* vs Dijkstra) is important, Data Quality (Accurate Incident Prediction) helps the algorithm make better decisions. Theoretical shortest paths are useless if the road is blocked; our system solves this.

Future improvements could include Real-time Traffic Feed integration (using APIs like TomTom) and Reinforcement Learning to optimize traffic light timings based on the flow data we are currently simulating.
