# Acknowledgements and Resources

We utilized several open-source libraries and resources to build this system. We acknowledge their authors and communities.

1.  PyTorch (Meta AI): The core Deep Learning framework used for our Transfer Learning implementation.
    -   Usage: Model definitions, autograd, and pre-trained weights.
2.  Leaflet.js: An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
    -   Usage: Rendering the OpenStreetMap tiles and handling the simulation layer.
3.  Bootstrap 5: A CSS framework for responsive design.
    -   Usage: creating the "Wizard" step interface and ensuring mobile compatibility.
4.  OpenStreetMap (OSM): Community-driven map data.
    -   Usage: Providing the background tile layer for visual context.
5.  Folium: Python wrapper for Leaflet.
    -   Usage: Initial prototyping of map visualizations before moving to custom logical rendering.
