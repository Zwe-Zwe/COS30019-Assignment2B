# PURPOSE: DNA Helix Ladder (TC10)
# Structure: Two parallel vertical rails connected by frequent rungs.
# This mimics a DNA helix or a ladder structure.
# Algorithms must decide whether to stay on one rail or switch to the other
# depending on edge weights.
#
# Nodes:
# Left Rail: 10001 - 10007
# Right Rail: 10008 - 10014
# Goal: 10014
