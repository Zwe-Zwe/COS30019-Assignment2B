# PURPOSE: Archipelago (Disconnected Graph) (TC06)
# Map simulates three distinct islands with no bridges connecting them.
# Island A: Start Node resides here.
# Island B: Goal Node resides here.
# Island C: Just another isolated cluster.
#
# Expected Behavior:
# A*, Dijkstra, BFS should exhaust all nodes in Island A and return "No Route Found".
# This verifies the software does not hang or crash when path is impossible.
