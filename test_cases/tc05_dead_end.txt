# PURPOSE: The Maze (Dead End Traps) (TC05)
# A Start Node spawns into four distinct "Corridors" (North, South, East, West).
# Only the WEST corridor leads to the Goal.
# The Top, East, and South corridors are deep, elaborate traps with multiple sub-branches
# that all end in dead ends. This tests DFS/BFS exploration efficiency.
#
# Nodes:
# Start: 5001
# Goal: 5020 (End of West Corridor)
# Traps: North Branch (5002-5006), East Branch (5007-5012), South Branch (5013-5016)
