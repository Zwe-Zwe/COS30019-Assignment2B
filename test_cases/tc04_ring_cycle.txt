# PURPOSE: Double Ring Road (TC04)
# A complex topology featuring two interconnected ring roads (East Ring and West Ring),
# forming a "Figure 8" or "Infinity Loop".
#
# Nodes:
# West Ring: 4001, 4002, 4003, 4004 (Core)
# East Ring: 4005, 4006, 4007, 4008 (Core)
# Intersection: 4002 Connects to 4005
#
# Tests if the algorithm can navigate out of one loop to get to another,
# or avoid infinite cycling in standard rings.
